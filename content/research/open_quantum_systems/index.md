All quantum systems are continuously exposed to and interact with their surroundings. Examples are electrons interacting with the electromagnetic field, atoms interacting with light (photons) or with crystal vibrations (phonons), impurities in a lattice interacting with nuclear spins of the atoms in the lattice. Generally, system-environment interaction leads to loss of quantum properties of the open system, and to the quantum to classical transition.

My research in this topic involves the following lines:
1. Study of the effects of noise on the dynamics of qubits as well as its impact on algorithms like spatial search
2. The development of new models describing open quantum systems, such as the stochastic collision model
3. The simulation of open quantum system dynamics with quantum simulators (such as the IBM Quantum devices or quantum optical setups)
