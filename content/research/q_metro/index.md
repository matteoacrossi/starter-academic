Quantum mechanics can be exploited to perform measurements with a precision is not achievable by means of purely classical approaches.
Quantum metrology is one of the most promising quantum technologies, with applications to sensing, imaging and precision measurement.
As all quantum technologies, quantum metrology is hindered by the presence of noise.

My research contributions in quantum metrology are related to quantum estimation theory, which deals with the mathematical quantification
of the ultimate precision achievable in the estimation of some parameters from experimental data.
I have been trying to understand when the features of quantum mechanics allow for an improvement of the precision over classical strategies.
Recently, I've been studying the use of time-continuous monitoring of quantum systems
to circumvent the effects of noise.
