abstract: We address the experimental implementation of a quantum simulator based
  on an optical setup. Our device can simulate the dynamical evolution of a qubit
  undergoing a dephasing process. In particular, we focus on the dynamics arising
  from the interaction with a classical stochastic field. We encode the state of the
  qubit in the polarization of a single photon, while the realizations of the stochastic
  evolution affect its spectral components by a programmable spatial-light-modulator.
  This setup can simulate in one shot the ensemble-averaged dynamics of the dephasing
  qubit. We experimentally reconstruct the system density matrix and we show how it
  is possible to move from a Markovian to a non-Markovian quantum map by changing
  the spectral parameter of the simulated noise.
