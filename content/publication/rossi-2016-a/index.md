abstract: We address the characterization of dissipative bosonic channels and show
  that estimation of the loss rate by Gaussian probes (coherent or squeezed) is improved
  in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity. In particular, enhancement of precision may
  be substantial for short interaction time, i.e. for media of moderate size, e.g.
  biological samples. We analyze in detail the behaviour of the quantum Fisher information
  (QFI), and determine the values of nonlinearity maximizing the QFI as a function
  of the interaction time and of the parameters of the input signal. We also discuss
  the precision achievable by photon counting and quadrature measurement and present
  additional results for truncated, few-photon, probe signals. Finally, we discuss
  the origin of the precision enhancement, showing that it cannot be linked quantitatively
  to the non-Gaussianity of the interacting probe signal.
