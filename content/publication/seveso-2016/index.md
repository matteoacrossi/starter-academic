abstract: A usual assumption in quantum estimation is that the unknown parameter labels
  the possible states of the system, while it influences neither the sample space
  of outcomes nor the measurement aimed at extracting information on the parameter
  itself. This assumption is crucial to prove the quantum Cram$backslash$'er-Rao theorem
  and to introduce the quantum Fisher information as an upper bound to the Fisher
  information of any possible measurement. However, there are relevant estimation
  problems where this assumption does not hold and an alternative approach should
  be developed to find the genuine ultimate bound to precision of quantum measurements.
  We investigate physical situations where there is an intrinsic dependence of the
  measurement strategy on the parameter and find that quantum-enhanced measurements
  may be more precise than previously thought.
