abstract: Noise-assisted transport phenomena highlight the nontrivial interplay between
  environmental effects and quantum coherence in achieving maximal efficiency. Due
  to the complexity of biochemical systems and their environments, effective open
  quantum system models capable of providing physical insights on the presence and
  role of quantum effects are highly needed. In this paper, we introduce a new approach
  that combines an effective quantum microscopic description with a classical stochastic
  one. Our stochastic collision model (SCM) describes both Markovian and non-Markovian
  dynamics without relying on the weak coupling assumption. We investigate the consequences
  of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of noise on transport efficiency in a fully
  connected graph and in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) complex. Our approach shows
  how to meaningfully formulate questions, and provide answers, on important open
  issues such as the properties of optimal noise and the emergence of the network
  structure as a result of an evolutionary process.
