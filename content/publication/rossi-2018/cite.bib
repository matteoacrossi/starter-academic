 abstract = {Continuous-time quantum walks may be exploited to enhance spatial search, i.e., for finding a marked element in a database structured as a complex network. However, in practical implementations, the environmental noise has detrimental effects, and a question arises on whether noise engineering may be helpful in mitigating those effects on the performance of the quantum algorithm. Here we study whether time-correlated noise inducing non-Markovianity may represent a resource for quantum search. In particular, we consider quantum search on a star graph, which has been proven to be optimal in the noiseless case, and analyze the effects of independent random telegraph noise (RTN) disturbing each link of the graph. Upon exploiting an exact code for the noisy dynamics, we evaluate the quantum non-Markovianity of the evolution, and show that it cannot be considered as a resource for this algorithm, since its presence is correlated with lower probabilities of success of the search.},
