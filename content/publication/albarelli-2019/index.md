abstract: 'We discuss the problem of estimating a frequency via [Formula: see text]-qubit
  probes undergoing independent dephasing channels that can be continuously monitored
  via homodyne or photo-detection. We derive the corresponding analytical solutions
  for the conditional states, for generic initial states and for arbitrary efficiency
  of the continuous monitoring. For the detection strategies considered, we show that:
  (i) in the case of perfect continuous detection, the quantum Fisher information
  (QFI) of the conditional states is equal to the one obtained in the noiseless dynamics;
  (ii) for smaller detection efficiencies, the QFI of the conditional state is equal
  to the QFI of a state undergoing the (unconditional) dephasing dynamics, but with
  an effectively reduced noise parameter.'
