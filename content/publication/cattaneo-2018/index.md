abstract: 'We address quantum spatial search on graphs and its implementation by continuous-time
  quantum walks in the presence of dynamical noise. In particular, we focus on search
  on the complete graph and on the star graph of order $N$, proving that also the
  latter is optimal in the computational limit $N backslashgg 1$, being nearly optimal
  also for small $N$. The noise is modeled by independent sources of random telegraph
  noise (RTN), dynamically perturbing the links of the graph. We observe two different
  behaviours depending on the switching rate of RTN: fast noise only slightly degrades
  performance, whereas slow noise is more detrimental and, in general, lowers the
  success probability. In particular, we still find a quadratic speed-up for the average
  running time of the algorithm, while for the star graph with external target node
  we observe a transition to classical scaling. We also address how the effects of
  noise depend on the order of the graphs, and discuss the role of the graph topology.
  Overall, our results suggest that realizations of quantum spatial search are possible
  with current technology, and also indicate the star graph as the perfect candidate
  for the implementation by noisy quantum walks, owing to its simple topology and
  nearly optimal performance also for just few nodes.'
