abstract: We study the population dynamics and quantum transport efficiency of a multi-site
  dissipative system driven by a random telegraph noise (RTN) by using a variational
  polaron master equation for both linear chain and ring configurations. By using
  two different environment descriptions -- RTN only and a thermal bath+RTN -- we
  show that the presence of the classical noise has a nontrivial role on the quantum
  transport. We observe that there exists large areas of parameter space where the
  combined bath+RTN influence is clearly beneficial for populating the target state
  of the transport, and for average trapping time and transport efficiency when accounting
  for the presence of the reaction center via the use of the sink. This result holds
  for both of the considered intra-site coupling configurations including a chain
  and ring. In general, our formalism and achieved results provide a platform for
  engineering and characterizing efficient quantum transport in multi-site systems
  both for realistic environments and engineered systems.
