abstract: 'We address the dynamics of a two-qubit system interacting with a classical
  dephasing environment driven by a Gaussian stochastic process. Upon introducing
  the concept of entanglement-preserving time, we compare the degrading effects of
  different environments, e.g. those described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or fractional
  noise. In particular, we consider pure Bell states and mixtures of Bell states and
  study the typical values of the entanglement-preserving time for both independent
  and common environments. We found that engineering environments towards fractional
  Gaussian noise is useful to preserve entanglement as well as to improve its robustness
  against noise. We also address entanglement sudden death by studying the entanglement-survival
  time as a function of the initial negativity. We found that: i) the survival time
  is bounded from below by an increasing function of the initial negativity, ii) the
  survival time depends only slightly on the process used to describe the environment
  and exhibits typicality. Overall, our results show that engineering the environment
  has only a slight influence over the entanglement-survival time, i.e. the occurence
  of entanglement sudden-death, while it represents a valuable resource to increase
  the entanglement-preserving time, i.e. to maintain entanglement closer to the initial
  level for a longer interaction time.'
