abstract: The advent of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology is changing
  rapidly the landscape and modality of research in quantum physics. NISQ devices,
  such as the IBM Q Experience, have very recently proven their capability as experimental
  platforms accessible to everyone around the globe. Until now, IBM Q Experience processors
  have mostly been used for quantum computation and simulation of closed systems.
  Here we show that these devices are also able to implement a great variety of paradigmatic
  open quantum systems models, hence providing a robust and flexible testbed for open
  quantum systems theory. During the last decade an increasing number of experiments
  have successfully tackled the task of simulating open quantum systems in different
  platforms, from linear optics to trapped ions, from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
  to Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics. Generally, each individual experiment demonstrates
  a specific open quantum system model, or at most a specific class. Our main result
  is to prove the great versatility of the IBM Q Experience processors. Indeed, we
  experimentally implement one and two-qubit open quantum systems, both unital and
  non-unital dynamics, Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. Moreover, we realise
  proof-of-principle reservoir engineering for entangled state generation, demonstrate
  collisional models, and verify revivals of quantum channel capacity and extractable
  work, caused by memory effects. All these results are obtained using IBM Q Experience
  processors publicly available and remotely accessible online.
