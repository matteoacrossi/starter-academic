abstract: It is commonly believed that decoherence arises as a result of the entangling
  interaction between a quantum system and its environment, as a consequence of which
  the environment effectively measures the system, thus washing away its quantum properties.
  Moreover, this interaction results in the emergence of a classical objective reality,
  as described by Quantum Darwinism. In this Letter, we show that the widely believed
  idea that entanglement is needed for decoherence is imprecise. We propose a new
  mechanism, dynamical mixing, capable of inducing decoherence dynamics on a system
  without creating any entanglement with its quantum environment. We illustrate this
  mechanism with a simple and exactly solvable collision model. Interestingly, we
  find that Quantum Darwinism does not occur if the system undergoes entanglement-free
  decoherence and, only when the effect of a super-environment introducing system-environment
  entanglement is taken into account, the emergence of an objective reality takes
  place. Our results lead to the unexpected conclusion that system-environment entanglement
  is not necessary for decoherence or information back-flow, but plays a crucial role
  in the emergence of an objective reality.
