abstract: Should the Dicke model of light-matter interaction include a diamagnetic
  term? This question has generated intense debate in the literature, and is particularly
  relevant in the modern contexts of cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics. We
  design an appropriate probing strategy to address the issue experimentally. Applying
  the tools of quantum estimation theory to a general Dicke model, we quantify how
  much information about the diamagnetic term (or lack thereof) is contained in the
  ground state of the coupled system. We demonstrate that feasible measurements, such
  as homodyne detection or photon counting, give access to a significant fraction
  of such information. These measurements could be performed by suddenly switching
  off the light-matter coupling, and collecting the radiation that naturally leaks
  out of the system. We further show that, should the model admit a critical point,
  both measurements would become asymptotically optimal in its vicinity. We finally
  discuss binary discrimination strategies between the two most debated hypotheses
  involving the diamagnetic term.
