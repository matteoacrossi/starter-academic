abstract: Quantum gravity theories predict a minimal length at the order of magnitude
  of the Planck length, under which the concepts of space and time lose every physical
  meaning. In quantum mechanics, the insurgence of such minimal length can be described
  by introducing a modified position-momentum commutator, which in turn yields a generalized
  uncertainty principle, where the uncertainty on the position measurement has a lower
  bound. The value of the minimal length is not predicted by theories and must be
  evaluated experimentally. In this paper, we address the quantum bound to estimability
  of the minimal uncertainty length by performing measurements on a harmonic oscillator,
  which is analytically solvable in the deformed algebra of the Hilbert subspace.
