abstract: We address the estimation of the magnetic field B acting on an ensemble
  of atoms with total spin J subjected to collective transverse noise. By preparing
  an initial spin coherent state, for any measurement performed after the evolution,
  the mean-square error of the estimate is known to scale as 1/J, i.e. no quantum
  enhancement is obtained. Here, we consider the possibility of continuously monitoring
  the atomic environment, and conclusively show that strategies based on time-continuous
  non-demolition measurements followed by a final strong measurement may achieve Heisenberg-limited
  scaling 1/J 2 and also a quantum-enhanced scaling in terms of the interrogation
  time. We also find that time-continuous schemes are robust against detection losses,
  as we prove that the quantum enhancement can be recovered also for finite measurement
  efficiency. Finally, we analytically prove the optimality of our strategy.
