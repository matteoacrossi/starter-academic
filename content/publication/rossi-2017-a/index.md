abstract: We address memory effects and diffusive properties of a continuous-time
  quantum walk on a one-dimensional percolation lattice affected by spatially correlated
  random telegraph noise. In particular, by introducing spatially correlated time-dependent
  fluctuations in nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes, we describe random domains
  characterized by global noise. The resulting open dynamics of the walker is then
  unraveled by an ensemble average over all the noise realizations. Our results show
  that time-dependent noise assisted by spatial correlations leads to strong memory
  effects in the walker dynamics and to robust diffusive behavior against the detrimental
  action of uncorrelated noise. We also show that spatially correlated classical noise
  enhances localization breaking, thus making a quantum particle spread on longer
  distances across the lattice.
