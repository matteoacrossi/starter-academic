abstract: Â© 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.We address the interaction of single- and two-qubit
  systems with an external transverse fluctuating field and analyze in detail the
  dynamical decoherence induced by Gaussian noise and random telegraph noise (RTN).
  Upon exploiting the exact RTN solution of the time-dependent von Neumann equation,
  we analyze in detail the behavior of quantum correlations and prove the non-Markovianity
  of the dynamical map in the full parameter range, i.e., for either fast or slow
  noise. The dynamics induced by Gaussian noise is studied numerically and compared
  to the RTN solution, showing the existence of (state dependent) regions of the parameter
  space where the two noises lead to very similar dynamics. We show that the effects
  of RTN noise and of Gaussian noise are different, i.e., the spectrum alone is not
  enough to summarize the noise effects, but the dynamics under the effect of one
  kind of noise may be simulated with high fidelity by the other one.
