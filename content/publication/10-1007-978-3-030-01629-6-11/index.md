abstract: We consider the estimation of a weak magnetic field B acting on a continuously
  monitored ensemble of atoms subjected to collective transverse noise. If N atoms
  are prepared in a coherent spin state and are not continuously monitored, the estimation
  precision scales with the total number of atoms according to the standard quantum
  limit $$$backslash$delta B^2 $backslash$sim 1/N$$. Remarkably, time-continuous monitoring
  of light that is coupled with the atomic ensemble, allows to achieve a Heisenberg
  limited precision $$$backslash$delta B^2 $backslash$sim 1/N^2$$. However this is
  typically obtained only for a large enough number of atoms N and with an asymptotic
  constant factor depending on the parameters characterizing the experiment. In this
  proceeding, after reviewing the analytical derivation of the effective quantum Fisher
  information that quantifies the ultimate precision achievable, we specifically address
  the role played by monitoring time and detectors measurement efficiency in obtaining
  a Heisenberg limited scaling. In particular we analyze the dependence on these experimentally
  relevant parameters of the asymptotic constant factor characterizing the effective
  quantum Fisher information, and, more importantly, the minimum value of atoms needed
  to observe the desired quantum enhancement.
