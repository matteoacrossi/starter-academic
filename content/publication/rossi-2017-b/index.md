abstract: We address the dynamics of a bosonic system coupled to either a bosonic
  or a magnetic environment and derive a set of sufficient conditions that allow one
  to describe the dynamics in terms of the effective interaction with a classical
  fluctuating field. We find that for short interaction times the dynamics of the
  open system is described by a Gaussian noise map for several different interaction
  models and independently on the temperature of the environment. In order to go beyond
  a qualitative understanding of the origin and physical meaning of the above short-time
  constraint, we take a general viewpoint and, based on an algebraic approach, suggest
  that any quantum environment can be described by classical fields whenever global
  symmetries lead to the definition of environmental operators that remain well defined
  when increasing the size, i.e., the number of dynamical variables, of the environment.
  In the case of the bosonic environment this statement is exactly demonstrated via
  a constructive procedure that explicitly shows why a large number of environmental
  dynamical variables and, necessarily, global symmetries, entail the set of conditions
  derived in the first part of the work.
