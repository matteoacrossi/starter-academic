abstract: © 2015 American Physical Society. ©2015 American Physical Society.We address
  the use of entangled qubits as quantum probes to characterize the noise induced
  by complex environments. In particular, we show that a joint measurement on entangled
  probes can improve estimation of the correlation time for a broad class of environmental
  noises compared to sequential strategies involving single-qubit preparation. The
  enhancement appears when the noise is faster than a threshold value, a regime which
  may always be achieved by tuning the coupling between the quantum probe and the
  environment inducing the noise. Our scheme exploits time-dependent sensitivity of
  quantum systems to decoherence and does not require dynamical control on the probes.
  We derive the optimal interaction time and the optimal probe preparation, showing
  that it corresponds to multiqubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states when entanglement
  is useful. We also show the robustness of the scheme against depolarization or dephasing
  of the probe, and discuss simple measurements approaching optimal precision.
